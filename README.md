# Usage

The .pbix files associated with each dashboard are hosted within this repository. After installing Power BI Desktop, download the .pbix files from the repository and open them with Power BI Desktop. The data sources are embedded within the files, eliminating the need for additional setup to explore the visualizations. Users can navigate through the dashboards using the tabs at the bottom of the Power BI interface to explore different visualizations and insights.

To download the .pbix files, navigate to the folder in this repository where they are stored, select a file, and use the 'Download' button. Cloning or downloading the entire repository is an alternative method for accessing all files.

# Data Sourcing

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from [Pwc Switzerland](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg) and available dataset's here below.
* Task 1. [Call Center Dataset](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Microsoft-Power-BI-PWC-PowerBI-Virtual-Case-Experience/blob/main/Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx)
* Task 2. [Churn Dataset](https://github.com/mroyalreddy07/Microsoft-Power-BI-PWC-PowerBI-Virtual-Case-Experience/blob/main/Churn-Dataset.xlsx)
* Task 3. []()

# Problem Statement

**Problem**
* The manager at PhoneNow telecom company seeks actionable insights from the call center dataset to understand customer satisfaction and agent performance trends over time.  
* A telecom manager requires transparency and analysis of call center data to identify long-term patterns in customer interactions and agent efficiency.  
* The manager at a major telecom firm is looking to analyze call center data for clear insights into customer behavior and agent performance over the long term.  

**Object** 
  Design a Power BI dashboard for Claire showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Ensure it provides clear insights into customer    
  satisfaction, agent performance, and call center trends.
  
- Interactive display of call trends and patterns.  
- Overview of agent performance and behaviors.  
- Summary of customer satisfaction metrics.  
- Comprehensive visuals for business discussions and deeper analysis.  
- Minimal interaction required for ease of use.  

**Possible KPIs** include (to get you started, but not limited to):

* Overall customer satisfaction
* Overall calls answered/abandoned
* Calls by time
* Average speed of answer
* Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

# Data Preparation

The dataset was imported into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for analysis. It underwent transformation in Power Query and was modeled for effective visualization.

# Data Cleaning
  The process of cleaning the dataset was completed in Power Query with the following steps.

* Unnecessary columns were removed.
* Each of the columns in the table was validated to have the correct data type.
* Unnecessary rows were removed

# Data Transformation
  The process of converting, cleaning, and structuring data into a usable format that can be analyzed to support decision making processes, and to propel the growth of an organization.
  an additional column named Satisfaction Likert was created for referencing using the M-formula:
  
# Data Modeling
  Once the dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready for modeling. However, as it contained only a single table, the data modeling process was minimal.
  
# Data Visualization

# Task 1

**Call Centre Trends**
  The first dashboard provides an in-depth look at call center performance metrics, including customer satisfaction, call volumes, and agent efficiency, helping to highlight opportunities for operational           enhancements.

# Task 2

**Customer Retention**
  Designed to support the telecom client's goal of enhancing gender balance at the executive level, this dashboard highlights key diversity and inclusion metrics. It provides actionable insights into trends,       progress, and areas requiring attention

# Measures
  The measure used in visualization are:
  
 * **Calculated measures**

  * Answered = CALCULATE(COUNT(Call_Center[Call Id]),FILTER(Call_Center,Call_Center[Answered (Y/N)]="Y"))
  * Resolved(Y) = CALCULATE(COUNT(Call_Center[Call Id]),FILTER(Call_Center,Call_Center[Resolved] ="Y"))

# Analysis and Insights
  The goal of this dashboard is to enable managers to explore the data independently, but I have outlined some key points of interest below.
